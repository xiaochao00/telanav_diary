Failure, exiting




Checking for presence of required libraries                 fatal

Your installation references loadable libraries that are missing from the
new installation.  You can add these libraries to the new installation,
or remove the functions using them from the old installation.  A list of
problem libraries is in the file:
    loadable_libraries.txt

[postgres@shb-dpc6x64ssd-01 update]$ more loadable_libraries.txt 
could not load library "$libdir/postgis-2.1":
ERROR:  could not access file "$libdir/postgis-2.1": No such file or directory

could not load library "$libdir/rtpostgis-2.1":
ERROR:  could not access file "$libdir/rtpostgis-2.1": No such file or directory
造假的文件，因为postgis2.1不支持postgresql9.6



Only the install user can be defined in the new cluster
see user:
\du
or
SELECT * from pg_authid;

drop user  dbadmin;
