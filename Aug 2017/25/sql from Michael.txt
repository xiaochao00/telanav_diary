Subject: Postgres tablespace location

In PostgreSQL, a tablespace can be used by any PostgreSQL database. (As long as the requesting user has sufficient privileges, that is.) I think this query
SELECT spcname, spclocation FROM pg_tablespace;
will show you the directory that index_old is using in the filesystem in PostgreSQL version through 9.1. Prowl around in there to see if something real is in your way. I'd be really cautious about trying to delete anything in there apart from using PostgreSQL's interface, though.
In 9.2+, try
select spcname, pg_tablespace_location(oid) from pg_tablespace;


Find the database tablespace, tablespace location, size.
SELECT datname, spcname, pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)),  pg_tablespace_location(t.oid) FROM pg_database d, pg_tablespace t WHERE d.dattablespace = t.oid order by spcname;
