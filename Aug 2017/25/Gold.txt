pg_default and pg_global locations are "hardcoded".
pg_default lives in:
select setting||'/base' from pg_settings where name='data_directory';
and pg_global lives in:
select setting||'/global' from pg_settings where name='data_directory';
src/backend/commands/tablespace.c says so:
 * There are two tablespaces created at initdb time: pg_global (for shared
 * tables) and pg_default (for everything else).  For backwards compatibility
 * and to remain functional on platforms without symlinks, these tablespaces
 * are accessed specially: they are respectively
 *          $PGDATA/global/relfilenode
 *          $PGDATA/base/dboid/relfilenode
Please also note, that exposing location of data directory is a - not so terrible but still - security hole.
